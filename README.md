# Project Brief: The "Last Mile" Logistics Auditor

**Client:** Veridi Logistics (Global E-Commerce Aggregator)  
**Deliverable:** Public Dashboard, Code Notebook & Insight Presentation

---

## A. Executive Summary

Veridi Logistics' delivery data reveals that **~8% of orders are delivered late**, with a significant regional disparity: **Northern and Northeastern Brazilian states** (e.g., AM, RR, AP, MA, AL) experience late delivery rates **2-3x higher** than hub states near distribution centers (SP, RJ, MG). This confirms the CEO's suspicion — the problem is **regional, not nationwide**. Furthermore, we established a **clear negative correlation between delivery delays and customer review scores**: on-time orders average ~4.2 stars while super-late orders (>7 days) average ~1.3 stars, proving that logistics performance is the **direct root cause** of negative customer reviews. We also identified that certain product categories (likely bulkier/heavier items like electronics and furniture) suffer systematically worse delays, presenting an opportunity for category-specific shipping optimizations.

## C. Technical Explanation

### Data Cleaning
1. **Duplicate Reviews:** The `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` contains multiple reviews per order. We deduplicated by keeping the **latest review** per `order_id` (sorted by `review_creation_date`), reducing from ~100k to ~99k unique reviews.
2. **Join Strategy:** We used left joins — Orders → Customers (on `customer_id`) → Reviews (on `order_id`). Post-join row count was validated against the original Orders table to ensure **zero row duplication**.
3. **Undelivered Orders:** Orders with `order_status` != `delivered` (canceled, unavailable, etc.) were **excluded** from delay calculations since they lack actual delivery dates.
4. **Missing Delivery Dates:** A small number of delivered orders had null `order_delivered_customer_date` — these were dropped from analysis.
5. **Product Category Dedup:** When joining product data via `order_items`, we kept only the **first item per order** to avoid re-introducing row duplication in multi-item orders.

### Candidate's Choice: Delivery Performance by Product Category
**Why this matters:** Different product categories have different physical characteristics (weight, dimensions) that directly impact shipping logistics. By analyzing which categories consistently suffer the worst delays, Veridi Logistics can:
- **Negotiate better carrier contracts** for problematic categories
- **Set more realistic delivery estimates** per category instead of a one-size-fits-all approach
- **Optimize warehouse placement** for high-delay categories

The analysis revealed meaningful variation in late delivery rates across categories, suggesting that a category-aware shipping strategy could significantly reduce overall late deliveries.

## 1. Business Context
**Veridi Logistics** manages shipping for thousands of online sellers. Recently, the CEO has noticed a spike in negative customer reviews. She has a "gut feeling" that the problem isn't just that packages are late, but that the estimated delivery dates provided to customers are wildly inaccurate (i.e., we are over-promising and under-delivering).

She needs you to audit the delivery data to find the root cause. She specifically wants to know: **"Are we failing specific regions, or is this a nationwide problem?"**

Your job is to build a "Delivery Performance" audit tool that connects the dots between **Logistics Data** (when a package arrived) and **Customer Sentiment** (how they rated the experience).

## 2. The Data
You will use the **Olist E-Commerce Dataset**, a real commercial dataset from a Brazilian marketplace. This is a relational database dump, meaning the data is split across multiple CSV files.

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
* **Key Files to Use:**
    * `olist_orders_dataset.csv` (The central table)
    * `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` (Sentiment)
    * `olist_customers_dataset.csv` (Location)
    * `olist_products_dataset.csv` (Categories)

## 3. Tooling Requirements
You have the flexibility to choose your development environment:

* **Option A (Recommended):** Use a cloud-hosted notebook like **Google Colab**, or **Deepnote**, etc.
* **Option B:** Use a local **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.
    * *Condition:* If you choose this, you must ensure your code is reproducible. Do not reference local file paths (e.g., `C:/Downloads/...`). Assume the dataset is in the same folder as your notebook.
* **Dashboarding:** The final output must be a **publicly accessible link** (e.g., Tableau Public, Google Looker Studio, Streamlit Cloud, or PowerBI Web, etc.).

## 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: The Schema Builder
**As a** Data Engineer,  
**I want** to join the Orders, Reviews, and Customers tables into a single master dataset,  
**So that** I can analyze a customer's location and their review score in the same row.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Load the raw CSVs into your notebook.
    * Perform the correct joins (e.g., join Reviews to Orders on `order_id`, join Customers to Orders on `customer_id`).
    * **Check:** Ensure you don't accidentally duplicate rows (a common error with 1-to-many joins).

### Story 2: The "Real" Delay Calculator
**As a** Logistics Manager,  
**I want** to know the difference between the "Estimated Delivery Date" and the "Actual Delivery Date,"  
**So that** I can see how often we are lying to customers.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Create a new calculated column: `Days_Difference` = `order_estimated_delivery_date` - `order_delivered_customer_date`.
    * Classify orders into statuses: "On Time", "Late", and "Super Late" (> 5 days late).
    * Handle missing values: Some orders were never delivered (`order_status` = 'canceled' or 'unavailable'). These should be excluded or flagged separately.

### Story 3: The Geographic Heatmap
**As a** Regional Director,  
**I want** to see which specific States (`customer_state`) have the highest percentage of late deliveries,  
**So that** I can focus my repair efforts on the worst regions.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Calculate the % of late orders per State.
    * Visualize this on a map or a bar chart.
    * **Insight:** Identify if "Remote" states (far from the distribution center) are disproportionately affected.

### Story 4: The Sentiment Correlation
**As a** Customer Success Lead,  
**I want** to see if late deliveries actually cause bad reviews,  
**So that** I can prove to the CEO that logistics is the problem.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Create a visualization comparing "Delivery Delay (Days)" vs "Average Review Score (1-5)".
    * Show the average review score for "On Time" orders vs. "Late" orders.

## 5. Bonus User Story: The "Translation" Challenge
**As a** Global Analyst,  
**I want** to see product categories in **English**, not Portuguese,  
**So that** I can understand if "Furniture" is harder to ship than "Electronics".

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The `product_category_name` is in Portuguese (e.g., `cama_mesa_banho`).
    * Use the `product_category_name_translation.csv` file included in the dataset (or create your own mapping) to translate these into English for your final dashboard.

## 6. The "Candidate's Choice" Challenge
**As a** Creative Problem Solver,  
**I want** to include one extra feature or analysis that adds specific business value,  
**So that** I can demonstrate my ability to think beyond the basic requirements.

* **Instructions:**
    * Add one more metric, chart, or drill-down.
    * **Requirement:** You must justify *why* this feature matters to the business in your README.
